Forest Revival Church was not created to market itself, to recruit for itself, or to fundraise for itself. It was not created to continuously accumulate members or to soften its standards to that end. It was not created to paywall mysteries.

Forest Revival Church was not created to satisfy a narcissistâ€™s seedy appetites. It was not created to suppress or subvert the wills of its adherents. It was not created to coerce people into indecent acts.

Forest Revival Church was not created to advocate political ideology or act as the paid shill of a political machine. It is not a platform for experimentation by the ruling class.
