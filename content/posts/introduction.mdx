Forest Revival Church is a community organized to provide fellowship to those stirred by the renewal of our eternal natural religion. Our faith is the universal and perennial religion whose traces go back tens of thousands of years. It is practiced today by indigenous peoples all over the world and by mystics both within and independent of all organized sects.

The goal of Forest Revival Church is to cultivate perfect goodness, perfect beauty, and perfect wisdom in our peoples and in the World. We will cultivate devotion to God with shrines, nature with gardens, and our members with spiritual and physical support.

We believe in the one God, the All-father, who creates and sustains the World. We believe in his divinity within all living beings and within matter itself. We believe in the gods, the innumerable personalities of God the Father, and that by the ineffable magic of their character the Law of Nature manifests.
