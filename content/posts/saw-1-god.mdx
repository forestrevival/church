We love the one whole, boundless, and hidden God. By him and within him all that is true is made, kept, and killed. He is Mind itself, he is Self itself. He is the endless Sky, Father of all worlds, and the dense Earth, Mother of all critters. He is wind, water, fire, and thunder. He is boulder, creek, and forest. He is thought, memory, dream, and truth. He who makes the world is the world itself and king within it.
