Our first church service was held on Discord voice chat and was attended by three members. This was a forum-style service as all attendees are elders. Our founding documents were read and discussed. We also talked about scriptures, tiers of the canon, ritual, and levels of communion with other groups. Our Church Constitution and Church Library projects were introduced. After socializing we shared our prayers for our loved ones affected by drug fiending. Seven friends have now joined our fellowship.
